# DESCRIPTION:
The Productivity Tracker is a Chrome extension built with React to help users track and enhance their productivity. It enables users to set daily goals, monitor the time spent on specific websites, and visualize productivity trends. The extension integrates browser APIs to track browsing activity and provides insights in an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

# Tools and Technologies Used:
1. React.js: Used for building the interactive user interface. React's state management (useState and useEffect) dynamically updates the extension's dashboard.
2. Chrome Extension APIs: Browser APIs such as chrome.storage and chrome.tabs are utilized to store data, monitor active tabs, and track website usage.
3. Chart.js: A library used for creating visual representations of productivity trends with interactive charts.
4. Bootstrap: Ensures a clean and responsive design for the extensionâ€™s popup and dashboard interface.
# How It Works:
1. Daily Goal Setting:
Users can set a daily productivity goal in the extension's popup interface.

2. Website Tracking:
The extension monitors the user's time spent on specific websites in real time using the browser activity APIs.

3. Productivity Visualization:
A dashboard visualizes the time spent on different websites with detailed charts, helping users identify patterns in their browsing behavior.

4. Data Storage:
All user data, including goals and time logs, are stored locally using chrome.storage, ensuring privacy and persistence across browser sessions.

5. Error Handling:
If the extension encounters an issue, such as restricted permissions or invalid inputs, it notifies the user with clear error messages.
This extension empowers users to optimize their productivity by offering actionable insights into their daily online habits and progress toward their goals.
